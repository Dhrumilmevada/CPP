--> This is C++ tutorial video series by YouTube channel cherno[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dudnM48yfGUldqGD0S4FFb].

--> This include the modeÌ£rn C++ feature which are available in newer version of C++11 and C++14.

--> In C++, It does not uses any kind of VM to convert code to machine language and execute it. So mainly precise code will execute faster with compare
to language which run inside VM.

--> C++ compiler only compiles .cpp file, header files are included as pre-processor. So all header file will be compiled prior to all source files along
with all pre-processor directives.

--> Task for compiler
    -> compile every source file separately.
    -> while compiling source, first process pre-processor directive like (#include, #pragma #ifdefine, #ifndefine).
    -> Compiler process pre-processor by just copy and paste those file on some parameter or condition.

--> Task for linker
    -> When project has more than one CPP and header file then linker has to play role to create executable file by link up all source files.

-->Static keyword outside class in global scope
    -> Any global fields in source file are accessible across all source files are there in project.
    -> To restrict this behavior, static keyword can be added to global field declaration.
    -> static keyword to global field declaration make will make them private to that source file. 

--> Static keyword outside class in local scope
    -> Whenever local fields declared static inside a function or any other block of code then its lifetime got increased to forever until the program 
       dies.
