--> C++ compiler compile every source file separately. If one source file has any kind of dependencies to other files which are declare, define and use in 
your project then they should be declare as pre-processor directives.

-->Header files can just include declaration of variables and functions. If definition of function is included in header file then it might possible
to have linker error. 
--> As here without including .h file to main.cpp file, program will be not compiled.

===>#pragma once
    -> It will restrict inclusion of header file to one in one source file.
    -> Conventional way of this is:-
        #ifndefine _FILENAME_H
        #define _FILENAME_H
            ...
            ...
            ...
        #endif

--> When header file is included with double-quotation which means compiler can locate it in relative of current file, but if it include with
angular bracket which means compiler have to look into one of include directory.
